This project (using the following link http://studentapp-env.eba-g3fdff2p.eu-north-1.elasticbeanstalk.com and the login username as barry and password as barry) aims to create a comprehensive web platform that enhances the university experience for all students, with particular focus on part-time and evening students (like I was myself at one point) who often miss out on traditional campus resources. I set out to build a website that tackles the isolation many students feel on traditional university platforms so that students can build genuine connections whether you're a mature learner returning to education, juggling work commitments or an international student navigating a new culture, everyone can access a vibrant university community, as well as provide tools for lecturers to better support their students.

The following features represent the initial development phase, with plans to incorporate additional functionality.

Students Academic Progress Tracking -View average grades with personalized insights showing proximity to the next grade tier -Motivational feedback system to boost academic confidence

Study Group Formation -Connect with course-mates to form collaborative study groups -Facilitate meetups for discussing course material and building peer relationships -Specially designed to bridge the social gap for part-time students
 a
Student Housing Network -Find compatible flatmates and house-sharing opportunities within the student community -Advanced filtering system to match housing preferences and lifestyle requirements -Connect students seeking shared accommodation

For Lecturers -Intuitive interface for accessing student academic records and performance data -Comprehensive student information management system -Streamlined access to essential student details
